1. Create a private GitHub repository and invite me as a collaborator (my username is dclamage)
2. For each stage of the tutorial do a git commit and push of your changes.
  a) Please use Unity version 2021.3.2f1 <br />
  b) Committing and pushing each stage as you go allows me to see that you went through the tutorial yourself. <br />
  c) Make sure you have committed everything needed to load the project into Unity and run it. <br />
  d) You will want to set up an appropriate .gitignore file for the Unity project. <br />
3. Think about a novel gameplay improvement that you’d like to make to the tutorial for phase two. <br />
  a) Don’t start implementing it yet, but have your ideas ready. <br />
  b) This improvement should involve programming and not just asset changes. <br />
  c) Don’t bite off more than you can chew – ensure this is something you can complete within a week. <br />
