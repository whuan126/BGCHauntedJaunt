1. Create a private GitHub repository and invite me as a collaborator (my username is dclamage)
2. For each stage of the tutorial do a git commit and push of your changes.
  a) Please use Unity version 2021.3.2f1
  b)Committing and pushing each stage as you go allows me to see that you went through the tutorial yourself.
  c) Make sure you have committed everything needed to load the project into Unity and run it.
  d) You will want to set up an appropriate .gitignore file for the Unity project.
3. Think about a novel gameplay improvement that you’d like to make to the tutorial for phase two.
  a) Don’t start implementing it yet, but have your ideas ready.
  b) This improvement should involve programming and not just asset changes.
  c) Don’t bite off more than you can chew – ensure this is something you can complete within a week.
